The purpose of this project is to classify the gender of a Three Spined Stickleback based on automatic landmarks detection and maching learning classification

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Landmarks detection}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Specific landmarks are computed through image processing \+: body length, body depth, head length, head depth...

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Distances calculation}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
All combinations of distances are calculated, and all combinations of triangles are computed to have all possible angles
